Cassini Structured Homepages uses LDAP authorization to provide a security layer to webpage content.

Built on PHP 5.2.9, the Cassini Structured Homepages Framework is
designed to facilitate dynamic generation of webpages tailored specifically to the
user. The main goal of the framework is to grant the site administrator the ability
to hide specific content according to the current user.
